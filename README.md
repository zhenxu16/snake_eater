# Snake_eater 🐍
This is my first game project, created as a class assignment to present to my instructor.   It was built using Python, with the Tkinter library for the GUI.

### Features:
- The player has **3 lives**. Colliding with the wall will result in losing a life.
- Eating a fruit will **increase the snake’s length**.
- The game uses a **countdown timer**. If the timer reaches zero, the game is over immediately.
- After the game ends, it displays the **highest score** and the **longest snake length** achieved during that play session.

## Tech Stack 🛠
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)

## Installation & Usage
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependency
```bash
pip install tk
